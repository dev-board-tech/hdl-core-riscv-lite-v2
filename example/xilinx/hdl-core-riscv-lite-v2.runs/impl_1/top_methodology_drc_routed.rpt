2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell risc_v_inst/skip_execution_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) rtc_inst/int_rst_int_n_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram_inst/mem_b0_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram_inst/mem_b1_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram_inst/mem_b2_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram_inst/mem_b3_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#5 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance rom_dp_inst/TMP_reg__0, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.048 ns between risc_v_inst/regs_inst/rda_del_reg[4]/C (clocked by core_clk) and risc_v_inst/PC_reg[5]/D (clocked by core_clk).
